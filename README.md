# My Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) Stuff

This repository contains some self-study work related to deep reinforcement learning.

- Recreating DRL algorithms
- Improving my software development skills through recreating AlphaGo
- My notes
- Practicing PyTorch and Keras.

TODO:
- Implement Jupyter notebook interface that shows two OpenAI Gym trajectories the user can choose from.
- Implement LSTM and GAN programs in Pytorch/Keras.
- Implement pruning techniques in Go-playing agent.
- Start meta-learning agent.
